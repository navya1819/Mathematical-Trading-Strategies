# Mathematical-Trading-Strategies üìà

## About me
I am Navya Nihal, student of IIT Kanpur. I am in my second year of pursuing B.S Economics. 
I am highly motivated towards studying and understanding financial models and structure of the real world.
I have a keen interest in stock markets too and I want to further expand my knowledge and understanding of trading in the stock market.

## Project Description
* This project was offered by Stamatics Society of IIT Kanpur and was mentored by Muditt Khurana and Shivam Pandey.
* The project was completed on JUPYTER NOTEBOOK written in Python.
* The yfinance module by Yahoo was used to import financial data from various time periods.
* The project went from analysing stocks for basic financial ratios to generating signals which I will briefly describe below.

# ASSIGNMENTS
## Assignment 1
 - As for Assignment 1, I had to choose 5 international indices and 5 equities from yfinance, load the daily data since ‚Äú2010-01-01‚Äù, and compute the Daily Returns, Cumulative Returns, Max Drawdowns, the Sharpe Ratio, and the Sortino Ratio if the stocks were bought, held for the day and sold when the market closed.
 - I chose NASDAQ Composite(IXIC), S&P 500(GSPC), Dow Jone Industrial Average(DJI), Russell 2000(RUT) and CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) for the analysis.
 - I ran a set of code and reported the data back as table at the end of my JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.
## Assignment 2
 - The objective of this assignment was to analyze the NASDAQ and NSE indices to identify their correlation and establish potential lead-lag relationships.
 - The next step was to code Keltner Channel, Bollinger Bands, and MACD indicators, determining the optimal parameters for these indicators on one of the indices, and generating buy and sell signals on the other index.
 - I ran a lead-lag analysis of 20 days and concluded that NASDAQ was leading NSE.
 - Then I plotted the charts given in the objective and used basic idea of stock trading to generate signals.
## Assignment 3
 - For Assignment 3, I had to select 10 stocks of my choice and identify the chart patterns. I had to edit out all the points on the stock's chart where the allotted chart patterns occur. The look-back period was 10 years with a 1-day tick interval.
 - I had to identify Descending Triangle pattern and plot it whereever it occured.
 - I ran code to look for 30 candles back and forth to identify the pattern and got some pinpoints in the chart.
## Assignment 4
 - For the final assignment of this project, I needed to design and implement an effective trading strategy using a combination of a technical indicator and a chart pattern or candlestick pattern. The objective was to optimize the strategy based on the evaluation criteria of cumulative returns, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio. I also provided a logical explanation regarding any limitations in detecting specific price trends. The strategy was tested on a 10 year period, ending on the submission day, using any chosen Indian equity.
 - I chose to analyse AXIS BANK. I plotted Keltner Channel and if the price is below the lower line of the Keltner Channel, it indicates a potential buying opportunity and if the price is above the upper line of the Keltner Channel, it suggests a potential selling opportunity.
 - Then I calculated important ratios such as cumulative returns, maximum drawdowns and sharpe ratio for the equity and submitted a final report in form of pdf.
